      <h3 className='bookTitle'>Handbook of Enterprise Architecture</h3>
      <p className='page'>Since the 1960's, with the widespread adoption of computing out of the world of science and mathematics and into the world of business and process automation, we've seen one innovation after another sweep through firms and governments, non profits, and even families.  As computing became more ubiquitous, we saw the combination of computing devices with cell phones, cameras, and sensors placed in our homes, offices, and on our bodies.  We can find our location on the planet, check our heart rate, order a pizza, have a doctor's appointment, and hold a business meeting, all from our personal devices.  
        <br/>
        <br/>With every innovation, and every transformation, we've seen Enterprise Architecture attempt to shine the light.  Not always called by this name, the field of Enterprise Architecture has grown from a top-down series of analysis techniques to a widely implemented business function.  Companies of all sizes, from large multinationals to small two office real estate companies have use the skills and talents of Enterprise Architects to guide their way through the possibilities, and improve their ability to meet the needs of their customers, citizens, and stakeholders.  
        <br/>
        <br/>As the field has grown, so have the tools and techniques in the Architect's toolbelt.  Different perspectives, different skills, and different outcomes have emerged as useful, practical, and directed.  This guide is an attempt to bring together these ideas, techniques, and skills.  
        <br/>
        <br/>As you peruse these pages, please think to yourself "is this useful?" and if the answer is no, that is your invitation to contribute.  Think about "what would it take to be useful?".  The next step is to become a member so that you can contribute.  You could write a stand alone article, or you could add pages to the handbook itself.  We will check you out, to make sure you are real and that you have some expertise in EA, but then, you are welcome to contribute.  This is a community driven, community built site.  Even the navigation is what the community makes of it, and it can change if the need arises.
